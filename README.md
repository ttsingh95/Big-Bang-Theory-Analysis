# Big-Bang-Theory Dialogue Analysis

BBT is one of my favorite tv shows - I love it so much that I have shamelessly rewatched seasons 1-6 (not so much 7 onwards since the content quality went downhill) and can almost recite the dialogue word for word

I wanted to take my deep devotion of the tv show to another level by playing around with the dialogue and seeing if I can derive any fun insights

So far I have only scraped the Pilot, however I might consider tweaking my code to include a for loop to scrape every episode for season one. I just don't want to overload the website therefore I might try to find an existing dataset that has extracted the dialogue lines and character names.
